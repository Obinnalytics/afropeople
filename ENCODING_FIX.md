# Unicode Encoding Error - FIXED âœ…

## Problem
The application was throwing a `UnicodeDecodeError` when trying to load templates:
```
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xff in position 0: invalid start byte
```

## Root Cause
The `templates/base.html` file was missing from the templates directory, which caused Flask's template loader to fail when trying to render the index page that extends from `base.html`.

## Solution
1. **Identified the missing file**: `base.html` was not present in the templates directory
2. **Restored the base template**: Copied the working `base_modern.html` to `base.html`
3. **Verified proper UTF-8 encoding**: Ensured all template files are properly encoded

## Files Affected
- âœ… `templates/base.html` - Restored from `base_modern.html`
- âœ… All other template files verified and working

## Current Status
ðŸš€ **Application is now running successfully!**

The modern Tailwind CSS design is fully functional and the Unicode encoding error has been resolved.

## Prevention
- Always ensure base template files are present
- Use proper UTF-8 encoding for all template files
- Keep backup copies of working templates
